# ECC Service Times v2

Plan-versus-actual service timing for Emmanuel Christian Center.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router + TypeScript
- Planning Center Services API (read-only, version `2018-11-01`)
- Supabase/Postgres (next build slice)
- Vercel

## Local setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Fill `PCO_CLIENT_ID` and `PCO_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env.local` from the dedicated
`communications@emmanuelcc.org` Viewer token. Never paste those values into
source files, chat, client-side code, or variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

Open `http://localhost:3000/api/pco/smoke` in development to verify visible
service types and their reported permissions. The smoke endpoint returns 404 in
production.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Security boundary

`src/lib/pco/client.ts` is server-only and exposes GET requests only. Planning
Center credentials never cross the server boundary. The dedicated PCO user owns
the external read-only permission boundary; the code reinforces it by providing
no write transport.

Planning Center requires HTTP Basic Auth for Personal Access Tokens, a User-Agent
header, and supports pinning `X-PCO-API-Version` per request.
